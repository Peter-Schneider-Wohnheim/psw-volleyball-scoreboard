# PSW Volleyball Scoreboard
A very simple app acting as a scoreboard for sports (e.g. volleyball matches). Intended to be run on a TV.

## Features
- Set the maximum score according to your needs on page load.
- Use the arrow-up key to increase the left and the arrow-down key to increase the right counter. This allows for using a PowerPoint Presenter as a remote control.

## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
